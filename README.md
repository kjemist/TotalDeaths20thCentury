# Total Deaths in 20th Century (United States)

**THIS REPOSITORY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repositoy contains data which describes the total death numbers in the 20th century in the United States (originally reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, **CDC**), an R-script which can visualize this data and graph figures (coming soon) generated by said script. Of special interest is the numbers related to infectious-related deaths in the 20th century, which demonstrates the schism between the pre- and post-antibiotic era.
